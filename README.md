# Basic-Python-for-Meteorology

As there are a number of people asking for the notebook file that I have used 2 years ago for [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMYJnyobByW5z7JCX9WhCy7QPehvnEdus), I have uploaded the files here and it is certainly okey for personal use. Please just take cautious note that these notebook were used for tutorial only.
